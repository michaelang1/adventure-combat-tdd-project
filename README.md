# App Academy Adventure Combat TDD project

## Tasks

1. Design a new inherited child class and feature
2. write a suite of Mocha/Chai test specs describing the features of your new class. The feature should include one or more new child classes that inherit from either `Item`, `Room`, `Character` or `Enemy`.
3. implement the feature from the specs

## Chosen Features to Work on

1. Create a `DarkRoom` that inherits from `Room` and a `Light` that inherits from `Item`.
2. Dark rooms show only a description of "You cannot see anything" unless the player picks up a light/lamp and switches it on.
